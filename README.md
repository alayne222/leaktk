# LeakTK

A growing toolkit of utilities for leak detection, mitigation and prevention.

## Usage Overview

```sh
# Run a single scan
leaktk scan https://github.com/leaktk/fake-leaks.git
leaktk scan --kind JSONData '{"key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----c5602d28d0f21422dfc7b572b17e6b138c1b49fd7f477d4c5c961e0756f1ff70-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"}'
leaktk scan --kind JSONData '@/path/to/some-file.json'

# Listen for requests
leaktk listen < ./examples/requests.jsonl

# See more options
leaktk help
```

When in `listen` mode, LeakTK listens on stdin, responds on stdout, and logs to
stderr. It reads one request per line and sends one response per line in
[JSONL](https://jsonlines.org/). It should always generate a response to each
request even if there were errors. More info on the formats are in the
[listen docs](./listen.md).

## Project Status

This project is actively used in prod and has proven to be reliable. However,
it is still pre-1.0 and its API may change.

What that means for you:

- Is it ready to use? Yep!
- Can I use it as a library? It's probably best to hold off for now.
- Will the CLI's input/output change? Probably, but we're trying to minimize
  that since that impacts us too.

If you plan to use this before v1.0.0 is released, we recommend that
you pin to a specific version and check for compatibility changes between
releases.
