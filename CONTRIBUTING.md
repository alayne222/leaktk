## Types of Contributions

See the [TODO list](README.md#todo) at the bottom of the README for
a prioritized list of items on this project.

## Guidelines

* Try to avoid extra libs when the feature would be small to implement
  from scratch
* Format the code with rustfmt
* Use [proper names](https://gist.github.com/bplaxco/f2a5a1b29f7510b0eb94505ac1b400c3)
  for variables and functions
* Sort and group `use` statements in the order built-in, external lib,
  internal crate lib, relative lib

## Notes

This project is still pretty new and several of us are still learning
rust's best practices. Expect the guidelines to grow as we learn more
and the project matures.

Generally speaking, try to write clean, idiomatic rust and make things
intuitively obvious to the most casual observer.

If you have any questions or aren't sure where to start, file an
issue on this repo.
